    	                  		There are many reasons why I recommend GoodBudget for you. Firstly, automatically entering information into an app allows us to realize how much money we are spending. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/retail-therapy/201306/why-we-overspend-credit">An article in <em>Psychology Today</em> states that "swiping a credit card is less psychologically painful than physically handing over cash." </a> By physically having to enter a number every time we swipe our card, we essentially force ourselves to realize how much money we are actually spending. <br>
Secondly, the GoodBudget app allows us to make a budget for each category we make purchases in. A budget for each category will allow you to know how much you have left in EACH category, rather physically examining your wallet to see how much is left in your budget as a whole. In this regard, GoodBudget is better than paying cash for similar purchases.
<br>
Lastly, some budgeting apps that automatically fills in information require your banking information. While many are trusted, some may misuse your information or sell it for a profit. Being a free app that doesn't require any private information, GoodBudget is an app that is a valuable extension to help you in budgeting.

                                Also, I highly recommend you contact your current credit card companies to inquire about the cash back options that are currently availiable to you. If you are able to use current accounts, you can save yourself from opening a new account which may harm your new credit section.

     			               Short answer: Yes. <br>
								Long answer: Yes, but you should do it anyways. New credit accounts for 10% of your total credit score. The decrease in credit score from opening one credit card will not harm your score significantly. Also, if you are looking to buy a new Home within 2 years, the credit account opened right now will carry less and less weight over time. However, there are many benefits. If you get 2% cash back on total monthly purcahses of $1500, you will get $360 at the end of the year for purchases that you would have made anyways. You may want to consider contacting your current credit card companies to inquire about cash back options avaliable on your current credit cards.

The Federal Trade Commmision has an <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0151-disputing-errors-credit-reports">excellent page</a> dedicated to disputing false information. It also provides you with a sample dispute letter that you can send to the credit reporting agency. I recommend you go there to find more information.

  			                  The best way to ensure there is no late payments occur is to pay off the balance before it is due. However, it is only neccessary to pay it on time. If you are able to pay it on time, then you are in excellent shape. However, I recommend that you keep at least a little bit of money in your bank account at all times, to ensure that you are able to fully cover your credit cards when the bill arrives. This could mean simply keeping less than $500 in your bank account at all times.

 			                   Preauthorized payments are an excellent way to pay off the minimum payment due for your credit cards. However, there are a few drawbacks. <br>
Firstly, preauthorized debit transactions require sufficient funds in your bank account to be processed. If your bank balance is insufficient, you may be charged with an overdraft fee. If there is not enough money in your account, paying off your credit cards manually will allow you a chance to deposit cash into the bank before paying off the bills. <br>
Secondly, manually paying off credit cards will allow you to spend all of your money to pay off your credit cards. Rather than using a pre-authorized debit to pay off the minimum balance due, paying it manually will let you see exactly how much money you can use to pay your credit cards. Using the majority of your bank balance to pay it off will save you interest charges. Many preauthorized debit users will forget about paying off the entire credit card balance, accuring high interest charges as their balance carries over every month. If you are still interested in pre-authorized debits and you are aware of these downfalls, please contact your bank or credit union and they will be happy to set it up for you.

However, I recommend credit cards as many offer a promotional 0% interest period, which will provide you with more than enough time to pay off your current $6200 of credit card debt. If you are interested in using another form of debt consolidation, please consider the interest period.

                    Most of the time, you should. But in the four months before your Home purchase, consider keeping 1% of your total balance for the next month.

                	I believe that most people are able to afford a Home. If you are able to rent a Home, you most likely will be able to buy a Home instead. Your maximum monthly mortgage payment is 28% your gross monthly monthly income. With that in mind, you can calculate the maximum Home you are able to buy. If you find that you are rejected for mortgages because of income related issues, you may want to consider finding a higher paying job or asking for promotion. Another option is to buy a smaller Home, as they typically will cost less money.

                	Foreclosure is one of the scariest experiances with buying a Home. There are many things that you can do to ensure it does not happen. Firstly, the most important thing to do is to keep an emergency fund. This could mean keeping $10,000 in your savings account at all time for if you ever lose your job. This fund should be able to keep you going until you  get back on your feet and seek further help. Secondly, contact your lender f you ever fall behind on your mortgage payments. Lenders typically do not want to foreclose your Home, and may lower your required mortgage payment until further notice (called a "forbearance"). This will ensure you will not lose your Home.

                I encourage you to speak with your accountant on this issue. Generally, I encourage you to contribute as much as possible to the downpayment of your Home. By saving for a large downpayment, you will be allowed to borrow money at the lowest possible rate, saving you thouthands of dollars in the long run. I also encourage you to continue saving for your retirement after your Home purchase.

                    Normally, it is not advisable to use your retirement savings plan to purchase a Home because of the penalties associated with the withdrawal. This includes a percentage penalty as well as heavy income tax on the withdrawl. Certain IRAs and 401(k) may allow you to borrow $10,000 for the Home without penalties, provided you pay it back after your Home purchase. It is a good idea to see if these penalty-free loans apply to you. If you are able to withdraw any money without penalties, I encourage you to do so before the purchase of your new Home and to pay it back after you buy your Home.

					Housing prices, like many other investments, are subject to price fluctuations in the short term. Over the long run, you will notice that Home prices will follow inflation, meaning that real housing prices are do not change during the long run. 
					If you are looking to purchase a house to live in, a house is an excellent decision. Housing gives your family peace of mind, with no fear of increased rents or housing problems. Also, you have the decision of making Home improvements as you see fit.

					Buying a house can be an stressful yet exciting time. It is important to know of a few other costs before considering a Home purchase. I would recommend knowing that purcahasing a Home can be expensive. There are other costs such as closing costs, inspection costs, and taxes. It is important to consider these costs when you are buying a Home. In addition, consider the annual maintainence expenses, interest, as well as utility expenses that may be paid for you when you were renting. 
                    If you want to know whether it's better financially to rent or buy, The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?abt=0002&abg=1">New York Times </a>has a calculator that calculates which is the better option. 
                    Another critism of Home buying is its inflexibiliy. After purchasing a Home, job mobility may be more difficult. If you find a new job in a different area, it may be harder to switch Homes for the new job.
