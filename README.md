#DECA Financial Consulting Event

##The Website

This is the website I created for my [DECA](http://deca.org/) event in 2015. It is intended to aid a client in raising their credit score and also prepare them to buy a home within 12 - 18 months. This was a part of my recommendation which helped me to win first place in the international competition in Orlando, Florida. 

##The Presentation

The consultation also consisted of me discussing my recommendations for the client as well as demonstrating how this website could help them achieve a higher credit score. A PowerPoint presentation was also used, but will not be released on GitHub. If you are interested in this PowerPoint, please email me at arthur.guo@uwaterloo.ca.
